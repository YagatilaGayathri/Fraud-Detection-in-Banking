Online Payment Fraud Detection Dashboard:

📌 Project Overview:

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning and visualizing insights with an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Key highlights:

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on millions of transaction records.

Built classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to detect fraud.

Handled class imbalance using undersampling techniques.

Achieved AUC score of ~0.99, successfully distinguishing fraudulent vs genuine transactions.

Developed a Streamlit dashboard with:

Dataset preview & summary

Fraud vs Non-Fraud analysis (bar chart & pie chart)

Interactive visualizations (transaction distribution, types, fraud counts)

Model training & evaluation (classification report, ROC curve)

Animated UI with Lottie JSON animation
